# multisig

Multisignature transactions (multisig) are transactions that require multiple signatures to spend the Bitcoin. A multisig address is created by combining multiple public keys and requires a specified number of those keys to be used in order to authorize a transaction.

To create a multisig transaction, several components are needed:

1. Multisig Address: The address that is used to receive funds in a multisig transaction. This address is created by combining multiple public keys and requires a specified number of those keys to be used to authorize a transaction.
2. Public keys: The public keys of the signers who will be involved in authorizing the transaction.
3. Private keys: The private keys associated with the public keys of the signers who will be involved in authorizing the transaction. These private keys are used to sign the transaction and authorize the transfer of Bitcoin.
4. Redeem Script: The redeem script is a script that specifies the conditions under which the funds can be spent. This script is generated using the public keys of the signers.
5. Signatures: Signatures are created by signing the transaction with the private keys of the signers involved in the transaction. The number of signatures required to spend the funds is determined by the multisig address.

# multisig.cpp

In this example, we first define the public keys of the signers and the number of required signatures to spend from the multisig address. We then create a script using the to_pay_multisig_pattern function from the bc::script class, which generates a script that requires the specified number of signatures from the listed public keys. We then use this script to generate the multisig address using the bc::wallet::payment_address class. Finally, we output the encoded multisig address.

# pubkey.cpp

This code uses the bc::secret_to_public function from the libbitcoin library to generate a public key from a private key. The private key is first generated using the bc::pseudo_random_fill function. The public key is then generated using the bc::secret_to_public function, and finally printed to the console using the bc::encode_base16 function.

# prikey.cpp

This code only generates a private key and outputs it to the console. Proper private key management involves storing the private key securely, using it to sign transactions, and never exposing it to unauthorized parties.

# script.cpp

This code uses the bitcoin library to generate two random private keys, and then derive the corresponding public keys. It then creates a multisig redeem script using the to_pay_multisig_pattern function from the script class. The to_pay_multisig_pattern function takes two arguments: the number of required signatures (2 in this case), and a vector of public keys (public_keys in this case). The redeem script is then printed out in hexadecimal format using the encode_base16 function.

# signatures.cpp

This code generates a signature for a message using a private key and then verifies the signature using the corresponding public key. The sign_message() function from the bitcoin library is used to generate the signature, and the verify_message() function is used to verify it.

Note that this is just an example, and in practice, you would want to use appropriate security measures, such as storing the private key in a secure manner and using secure communication channels for transmitting the signature.
